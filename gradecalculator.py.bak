This GPA Calculator works exclusively with Hunter College High School, and is not guaranteed to reflect the system of any other school Hunter inputs each letter grade with the highest possible numerical grade it could be, and then averages it. If you failed a class, this GPA calculator will not work for you. This is because I don't know how Hunter factors in failed classes. I am working on an update to fix that. Follow all directions carefully. If you do not follow the directions, you will crash the program...code is finicky!"
